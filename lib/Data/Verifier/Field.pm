Data::Verifier::Field - Field from a Data::Verifier profile

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Verifier;

    my $dv = Data::Verifier->new(profile => {
        name => {
            required    => 1,
            type        => 'Str',
            filters     => [ qw(collapse trim) ]
        }
        age  => {
            type        => 'Int';
        },
        sign => {
            required    => 1,
            type        => 'Str'
        }
    });

    my $results = $dv->verify({
        name => 'Cory', age => 'foobar'
    });


    my $field = $results->get_field('name);
    say $field->value;

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 original_value

The string value of the field before any coercion.  This will survive
serialization whereas value will not.

=head2 reason

If this field is invalid then this attribute should contain a "reason".  Out
of the box it will always contain a string.  One of:

=head2 valid

Boolean value representing this fields validity.

=head2 value

The value of this field.  This will not be present if serialized, as it could
be any value, some of which we may not know how to Serialize.  See
C<original_value>.

A dependent check failed.

=item B<has_coerced_value>

Predicate for the C<coerced_value> attribute.

=item B<max_length>

The value was larger than the field's max length.

=item B<min_length>

The value was shorter than the field's min length.

=item B<post_check>

The post check failed.

=item B<type_constraint>

The value did not pass the type constraint.
